# C++ Inheritance Examples

This repository provides a collection of C++ programs demonstrating the concept of inheritance, a fundamental feature in object-oriented programming. Each program showcases a different aspect of inheritance, highlighting its application in creating hierarchies and reusing code efficiently.

## Programs Included:

### 1. **Employee Inheritance:**
   - Illustrates inheritance in the context of employee types, with a base class `Employee` and derived classes `Manager` and `Engineer`.

### 2. **Shape Inheritance:**
   - Demonstrates a simple inheritance hierarchy for shapes, with a base class `shape` and a derived class `rectangle`. Calculates and displays the area of a rectangle.

### 3. **Student Information:**
   - Presents an example of inheritance for a `Person` class and a derived `Student` class. Displays both general information and student-specific details.

### 4. **Triangle Inheritance:**
   - Expands on the shape inheritance concept with a base class `shape` and a derived class `triangle`. Computes and outputs the area of a triangle.

**Feel free to explore, modify, and use these examples to deepen your understanding of inheritance in C++. Each program is well-commented to aid comprehension. Happy coding!**
